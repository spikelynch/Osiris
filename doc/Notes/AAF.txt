AAF Authentication.

Have tangled myself into knots getting AAF integration going.  Starting 
to untangle.


AAF Rapid process:

1:     Arrive at any Osiris page without a session/user.

2:     Redirect to the AAF with the correct URL

3:     User authenticates at the AAF+their institution

4:     AAF sends a POST to our /auth/aaf endpoint, which decrypts
       and verifies it, and then redirects to the home page.


ALSO:

1:     Arrive at Osiris without a session

2:     We are running in fake_aaf mode, so redirect to our own fake AAF page

3:     (no counterpart)

4:     the fake AAF page posts to /auth/aaf, which knows that we are 
       running in fake_aaf mode, so it just shows the decrypted attributes,


So the logic in the before clause has to be:

* Do they have a session? If so - do nothing, let em go through

* Is this request going to /auth/aaf? If so - part of authentication

* Are we in fake_aaf mode, and is this a reqeust to the fake AAF page? - pass

* no session, and not part of an authentication process, so redirect
  to either the fake aaf page or the actual AAF page.






NOTE
In 4 - the original code stashed the original path from 1 and redirected
the user back there once they'd logged in.  But I don't think we can send
the path on the trip to the AAF and back, so now they always go back to 
the front page after authentication.
