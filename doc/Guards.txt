Notes on guards

- bits of js which check parameter validity on the client side.


For a given param, check:

* If it's a file, check it against the filter

* If text: basic type validation - int/double/string

* If there's no default value, ensure that it's not empty

* If range guards are present (< > etc) check this

Note that there are no inclusions or exclusions on parameters -
they are all used on 




* If it has no value, make sure that it is not INCLUDED

* If it has a value, make sure that it's not EXCLUDED




json data structure for this:






{
        type => 'text|inputfile|outputfile',
        default => 'defau
