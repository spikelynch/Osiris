Osiris
======

Osiris provides a web interface to the USGS' Isis suite of planetary science
utilities.

See http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/ for full details about Isis.

Osiris uses a Perl Dancer app to provide web interfaces to the Isis
utilities and a POE event-driven daemon to mangage Isis processes.

Osiris was developed at the University of Technology, Sydney by Mike
Lynch.

The development of Osiris was funded by ANDS - the Australian Research
Data Service - as part of the data capture project DC18.
