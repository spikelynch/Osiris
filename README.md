Osiris
======

Osiris provides a web interface to the USGS' Isis suite of planetary science
utilities.

See http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/ for full details about Isis.

Osiris uses a Perl Dancer app to provide web interfaces to the Isis
utilities and a POE event-driven daemon to mangage Isis processes.

Osiris was developed at the University of Technology, Sydney by Mike
Lynch.


Development was funded by [ANDS, the Australian
National Data Service](http://www.ands.org.au/), as part of the UTS Data Capture project DC18.
