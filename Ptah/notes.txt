What Ptah has to do:

* poll the working director for each user

  - see if there are any new jobs:

      - For new jobs, start a child process for each of them,
        and flag that the job in question is in process

* when a child process terminates, save the state to the
  user's job list (either success or failure) and
  do something to notify the user (send an email)


Osiris::User

 - this class maintains the list of jobs in a user's directory,
   assigns new jobs a unique ID, and reads job files
